# 🧠 Tip Prediction Using Linear Regression

This project builds a machine learning model using **Multiple Linear Regression** to predict restaurant tips based on features like the bill amount, group size, and smoker status.

---

## 📌 Overview

- Cleaned and explored the dataset (`seaborn`'s **tips** dataset)
- Handled categorical variables using one-hot encoding
- Trained a multiple linear regression model
- Evaluated the model using MAE, MSE, RMSE, and R² Score
- Improved performance using feature selection

|--------|-------|
| MAE    | 0.6674 |
| MSE    | 0.6866 |
| RMSE   | 0.8286 |
| R²     | 0.4507 |
